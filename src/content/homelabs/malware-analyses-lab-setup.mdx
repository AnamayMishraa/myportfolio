# Malware Analyses Lab Setup: FlareVM and Remnux

You will understand how to create an isolated virtual environment which is safe to analyse dangerous malware samples and learn to create a network to isolate VMs from host machine.

## ðŸ§© Lab Scenario

1. A simple yet effective lab to analyse malware samples.

## ðŸ’» Step 1 - Install Virtualization Software (Eg [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads))

1. Download virtual box setup depending on your OS:
   ```bash
    Windows hosts
    MacOS
    Linux Distributions
    ```
2. Keep the setup settings as default(Recommended).
3. Open the virtualization software.

## ðŸ’» Step 2 - Install [Remnux](https://docs.remnux.org/install-distro/get-virtual-appliance#general-ova)  

Download the virtual box .ova file .And follow the instructions as mentioned.

## ðŸ’» Step 3 - Install Windows 10 ISO.

- Go to the [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10) Website.

- Download the Windows 10 Media Installation.

- Run the installation and choose ISO to create a Windows 10 iso file.

- Use that ISO file to create a Windows 10 VM.

## ðŸ’» Step 4 - Install FlareVM

- Go to this [Github](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm) Repo and follow the instructions as mentioned.

- After running .\install.psi, you may encounter installation getting stuck during some program installation such as vscode.Wait 10-20 mins and if it is still stuck right click on the powershell and it will skip it.



## ðŸš¨ [IMPORTANT] Follow further steps carefully to make your environment isolated.
```bash
- It is important to create an isolated environment to prevent malware getting leak to host machine.
- Go to File > Tools > Network Manager of VirtualBox.
- Create a new `Host-only Network` adapter.
- Below you will see two sections - `Adapter` and `DHCP Server`.
- Click on "Configure Adapter Manually" and set the value as :
```

```bash   
    IPv4 Address: 10.0.0.1
    IPv4 Network Mask: 255.255.255.0
    IPv6 Address: *leave as default*
    IPv6 Prefix Length: *leave as default*
```

- Now go to DHCP server pane and check "Enable Server".
- Set the value as -

```bash
    Server Address: 10.0.0.2
    Server Mask: 255.255.255.0
    Lower Bound: 10.0.0.3
    Upper Bound: 10.0.0.4
```

- Now go to settings of both FlareVM and RemNux and set network from NAT (or Bridged) to Host Only network adapter and select the new network adapter which you created.
 
- Remember to take snapshots of each vm one more time with all these configurations set up.
