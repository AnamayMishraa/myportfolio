# Detection Engineering Lab: Elastic SIEM vs Cobalt Strike

This homelab compresses my full detection tuning workflow into a single evening run. You will stand up Elastic Stack inside Docker, forward Windows telemetry with Sysmon, emulate a Cobalt Strike beacon using Caldera, and solidify a Sigma rule that survives production deployment.

> **Rationale**: I use this setup to regression-test content before it goes to production SOC environments. The lab intentionally limits hardware to consumer gear, forcing optimizations that translate well to constrained enterprise nodes.

## 📡 Architecture Overview

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Caldera Operator] -->|ATT&CK T1105| B[Windows Target VM];
  B -->|Sysmon Logs (EVTX)| C[Winlogbeat];
  C -->|TCP/5044| D[Logstash];
  D -->|Enriched Events| E[Elasticsearch];
  E --> F[Kibana Detection Dashboards];
  E --> G[Sigma CLI Pipeline];
```

- **Collection**: Sysmon with custom configuration tuned for command-line and network telemetry.
- **Processing**: Logstash pipeline disables field explosion and retains only ATT&CK-relevant fields.
- **Detection**: Sigma rule automation transforms YAML into Elastic Detection Rules via CLI.
- **Validation**: Saved searches plus detection alerts confirm the analytic catches beacon spawn and lateral process injection attempts.

## 🚀 Step 1 — Provision Elastic Stack

1. Clone my baseline compose file:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zer0spin/homelab-detection-stacks.git
   cd homelab-detection-stacks/elastic-minimal
    ```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set passwords (use `openssl rand -base64 18`).
3. Start the stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   docker compose ps
   ```
4. Validate health via `https://<ubuntu-ip>:5601` and enroll the built-in Fleet Server.

> Keep Elasticsearch JVM heap at 2 GB; the goal is to mimic resource-constrained analysts laptops.

## 🛡️ Step 2 — Harden Sysmon Noise Profile

1. Install Sysmon (v15+) on the Windows VM using Olaf Hartong's modular config:
   ```powershell
   .\Sysmon64.exe -i sysmonconfig-export-block.xml -accepteula
   ```
2. Apply the noise suppression patch shipped in `./configs/sysmon/zer0spin-detections.xml` to track LOLBins without drowning in events.
3. Confirm event flow with:
   ```powershell
   Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational'; Id=1} -MaxEvents 5
   ```

## 🎯 Step 3 — Execute ATT&CK Atomic via Caldera

1. Launch Caldera with the `sandcat` plugin enabled.
2. Create an operation targeting the Windows VM using the **Built-in Cobalt Strike** adversary profile.
3. Run the following abilities:
   - `T1105` — remote payload execution (reverse shell).
   - `T1059.003` — PowerShell spawn with encoded command.
   - `T1569.002` — Service execution for persistence test.
4. Annotate timestamps; later you will correlate them inside Kibana to prove detection fidelity.

## 🧠 Step 4 — Craft Detection & Deploy

Create a Sigma rule in `rules/cobalt_strike_spawn.yml`:

```yaml
detection:
  selection:
    EventID: 1
    Image|endswith:
      - "\\rundll32.exe"
    CommandLine|contains|all:
      - "C:\\Users"
      - "-enc"
  condition: selection
level: high
```

Publish it to Elastic Detection Engine:

```bash
sigma convert -t es-qs rules/cobalt_strike_spawn.yml | tee generated/rule.ndjson
python scripts/es_push_rule.py generated/rule.ndjson
```

The helper script authenticates against Kibana API and creates the detection rule with schedule `5m`.

## ✅ Step 5 — Validate and Tune

1. Inside Kibana > Security > Alerts, ensure at least one alert fired matching your operation timestamp.
2. Confirm the alert contains fields:
   - `process.command_line`
   - `host.name`
   - `event.code`
3. Use the saved search `detections/cobalt_strike_validation.ndjson` to visualize distinct hosts.
4. Document a false positive analysis session; note any legitimate PowerShell automation excluded by your rule.

## 🌀 Continuous Improvement Hooks

- Export detection coverage by running:
  ```bash
  python scripts/mapping/export_mitre_matrix.py --rule cobalt_strike_spawn.yml
  ```
- Schedule nightly replays with Caldera's autonomous mode to prevent detection drift.
- Publish final artifacts (Sigma + Elastic JSON) to your GitHub security-content repository.

## 📦 Deliverables Checklist

- [x] Docker Compose stack running with TLS-enabled transport.
- [x] Sysmon tuned configuration committed under version control.
- [x] Sigma analytic validated with at least **one** true positive alert.
- [x] MITRE ATT&CK mapping exported (T1059, T1105, T1569).
- [x] Runbook notes stored in `./docs/runbook.md` for rapid replays.

When you can re-run this lab in under 30 minutes and still catch the beacon, the detection is ready for enterprise promotion.
