Brazil's cybersecurity community is growing fast, but knowledge is scattered across dozens of Telegram groups, Discord servers, and personal blogs. **Finding reliable information is a treasure hunt**‚Äîand networking feels like shouting into the void.

I built **Cybersec-BR** to fix this.

---

## The Problem

When I started my cybersecurity journey, I faced:

**Information Overload**:
- 50+ Telegram groups with duplicate content
- No centralized study guides
- Conflicting advice on career paths

**Fragmented Community**:
- Hard to find mentors
- No platform to showcase projects
- Limited networking opportunities

**Outdated Career Advice**:
- Generic "learn Python and Linux" recommendations
- No data-driven insights on job market
- Unclear certification ROI

**I wanted to create the resource I wish existed when I started.**

---

## The Vision

**Cybersec-BR** is an open-source GitHub repository designed to be:

1. **Central Knowledge Hub**: One place for all Brazilian cybersecurity resources
2. **Career Accelerator**: Data-driven guidance based on real job postings
3. **Community Platform**: Space for professionals to connect and collaborate
4. **Open & Collaborative**: Community-driven content that improves over time

**Not just another link dump‚Äîa structured, actionable knowledge base.**

## What's Inside

### 1. Study Guides (Trilhas de Estudo)

**Structured learning paths** for different specializations:

**Blue Team Track**:
```markdown
## Blue Team Security Analyst Path

### Phase 1: Foundations (3-6 months)
- [ ] Networking basics (OSI model, TCP/IP, common protocols)
- [ ] Linux fundamentals (command line, file system, permissions)
- [ ] Windows administration (Active Directory, Group Policy, PowerShell)
- [ ] Security basics (CIA triad, threat modeling, risk assessment)

### Phase 2: Defensive Tools (3-6 months)
- [ ] SIEM platforms (Splunk, ELK, Sentinel)
- [ ] EDR solutions (CrowdStrike, Carbon Black, Defender)
- [ ] IDS/IPS (Snort, Suricata, Zeek)
- [ ] Log analysis and correlation

### Phase 3: Threat Detection (6-12 months)
- [ ] MITRE ATT&CK framework

### 2. Career Paths (Carreiras)

**Data-driven career guidance** based on **1000+ real job postings** analyzed:
