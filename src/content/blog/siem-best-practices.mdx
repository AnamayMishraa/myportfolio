A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system is the cornerstone of modern security operations centers (SOCs). When properly implemented and maintained, a SIEM provides comprehensive visibility into your security posture, enabling rapid threat detection and response.

## Understanding SIEM Fundamentals

### What is SIEM?

SIEM combines Security Information Management (SIM) and Security Event Management (SEM) into a unified platform that:

- Collects and aggregates log data
- Correlates events across sources
- Detects security incidents
- Generates alerts and reports
- Supports compliance requirements

### Core SIEM Components

```typescript
// SIEM Architecture Overview
interface SIEMArchitecture {
  dataCollection: {
    logSources: string[];
    collectors: string[];
    parsers: string[];
  };
  dataProcessing: {
    normalization: boolean;
    enrichment: boolean;
    correlation: boolean;
  };
  storage: {
    hotStorage: string;
    warmStorage: string;
    coldStorage: string;
  };
  analysis: {
    realTime: boolean;
    historical: boolean;
