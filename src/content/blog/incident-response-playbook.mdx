# Building an Effective Incident Response Playbook

Incident response playbooks are the backbone of effective security operations. They provide structured, repeatable processes that enable security teams to respond quickly and consistently to security incidents. In this guide, we'll explore how to build, implement, and maintain effective incident response playbooks.

## What is an Incident Response Playbook?

An incident response playbook is a documented set of procedures that guides security teams through the detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery phases of a security incident. Think of it as a recipe book for handling specific types of security events.

### Key Components

A comprehensive playbook should include:

1. **Trigger Conditions** - What initiates this playbook
2. **Roles and Responsibilities** - Who does what
3. **Step-by-Step Procedures** - Detailed action items
4. **Decision Trees** - Logic for different scenarios
5. **Communication Templates** - Stakeholder notifications
6. **Evidence Collection** - Forensic procedures
7. **Recovery Steps** - Return to normal operations

## Common Playbook Types

### 1. Phishing Incident Response

**Trigger**: User reports suspicious email or phishing detection system alert

**Initial Steps**:
```bash
# Quarantine the email
quarantine-email --message-id <ID> --reason "Phishing investigation"

# Check for similar emails
search-emails --sender <sender> --timeframe "last 24h"

# Extract indicators
extract-iocs --email <email-file> --output iocs.json
```

**Analysis Phase**:
- Verify email headers and sender reputation
- Analyze any attachments in sandbox environment
- Check URLs against threat intelligence feeds
- Determine if credentials were compromised

**Containment**:
- Block sender domain/email at gateway
- Reset passwords for affected users
- Revoke active sessions
- Update email filtering rules

### 2. Malware Outbreak

**Trigger**: Endpoint detection system flags malware or unusual behavior

**Initial Response**:
```python
# Isolate affected systems
def isolate_endpoints(endpoint_list):
    for endpoint in endpoint_list:
        edr_client.isolate(endpoint.id)
        log_action(f"Isolated {endpoint.hostname}")
        notify_soc(f"Endpoint {endpoint.hostname} isolated")
```

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Capture memory dump from infected system
2. Collect process list and network connections
3. Review recent file modifications
4. Check lateral movement indicators
5. Identify patient zero

**Eradication**:
- Remove malware from all affected systems
- Patch vulnerabilities that allowed infection
- Update detection signatures
- Verify no persistence mechanisms remain

### 3. Ransomware Attack

**Critical First Actions** (within 5 minutes):
```bash
# Immediate network isolation
isolate-segment --vlan <affected-vlan>

# Snapshot backups
backup-snapshot --all --priority critical

# Kill ransomware process
kill-process --name <ransomware> --force
```

**Assessment Phase**:
- Identify ransomware variant
- Determine encryption scope
- Check backup integrity
- Evaluate decryption options
- Document ransom demands (DO NOT PAY YET)

**Recovery Strategy**:
1. Restore from known-good backups
2. Rebuild critical systems from scratch
3. Implement network segmentation
4. Deploy additional monitoring
5. Conduct post-incident review

## Playbook Development Process

### Step 1: Identify Common Incident Types

Analyze your organization's:
- Historical incidents
- Industry-specific threats
- Regulatory requirements
- Business-critical assets

### Step 2: Define Scope and Objectives

For each playbook:
```markdown
## Playbook: [Incident Type]

**Objective**: [What success looks like]
**Scope**: [Systems/data covered]
**Severity Levels**: [How to categorize]
**SLA Targets**:
  - Detection: X minutes
  - Containment: Y minutes
  - Resolution: Z hours
```

### Step 3: Map Procedures to NIST Framework

Align your playbooks with NIST Incident Response phases:

1. **Preparation** - Tools, training, baseline configuration
2. **Detection & Analysis** - Alert triage, scope determination
3. **Containment** - Short-term and long-term isolation
4. **Eradication** - Root cause removal
5. **Recovery** - System restoration, validation
6. **Post-Incident** - Lessons learned, improvements

### Step 4: Create Decision Trees

```
Phishing Alert Received
    |
    ├─> User clicked link?
    |       ├─> YES -> Credential harvest suspected
    |       |           └─> Reset password + MFA check
    |       └─> NO -> Low priority monitoring
    |
    └─> Attachment opened?
            ├─> YES -> Potential malware execution
            |           └─> Isolate endpoint + scan
            └─> NO -> Email analysis only
```

### Step 5: Define Communication Plan

**Internal Notifications**:
- SOC Team: Slack #incidents channel
- Management: Email within 1 hour for P1/P2
- Legal: For data breach scenarios
- PR: For potential public disclosure

**External Communications**:
- Law Enforcement: For criminal activity
- Regulators: For compliance violations
- Customers: For data exposure
- Partners: For supply chain impacts

## Automation Opportunities

### SOAR Integration

Modern Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms can automate playbook execution:

```python
# Example SOAR playbook automation
class PhishingPlaybook:
    def __init__(self, alert):
        self.alert = alert
        self.iocs = []

    def execute(self):
        # Automatic enrichment
        self.enrich_sender()
        self.analyze_urls()
        self.check_attachments()

        # Automated containment
        if self.threat_score > 80:
            self.quarantine_email()
            self.block_sender()
            self.notify_users()

        # Generate incident ticket
        self.create_ticket()

        return self.incident_report()
```

### Automated Evidence Collection

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automated forensic data collection

INCIDENT_ID=$1
EVIDENCE_DIR="/forensics/${INCIDENT_ID}"

# Create evidence directory
mkdir -p ${EVIDENCE_DIR}

# Collect system information
systeminfo > ${EVIDENCE_DIR}/system_info.txt

# Capture network connections
netstat -ano > ${EVIDENCE_DIR}/network_connections.txt

# Export recent logs
Get-EventLog -LogName Security -Newest 1000 |
    Export-Csv ${EVIDENCE_DIR}/security_events.csv

# Calculate hashes for chain of custody
find ${EVIDENCE_DIR} -type f -exec sha256sum {} \; > ${EVIDENCE_DIR}/checksums.txt
```

## Playbook Maintenance

### Regular Updates

- **Quarterly Reviews**: Update procedures based on new threats
- **Post-Incident Reviews**: Incorporate lessons learned
- **Technology Changes**: Update for new tools/systems
- **Tabletop Exercises**: Test playbooks with team

### Version Control

Treat playbooks like code:
```bash
git add playbooks/ransomware-response.md
git commit -m "Update ransomware playbook - add network isolation step"
git push origin main
```

### Metrics and KPIs

Track playbook effectiveness:
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)
- Mean Time to Contain (MTTC)
